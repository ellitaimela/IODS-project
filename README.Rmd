## Introduction to Open Data Science, fall 2018

This project is for the course Introduction to Open Data Science in University of Helsinki, fall 2018. The learning objectives of this course are to understand possibilities of open science, open data, and open research tools, visualize and analyze data sets with some fairly advanced statistical methods, master a few state-of-the-art, freely available, open software tools, apply the principle of reproducible research and see its practical advantages, and learn more of all this in the near and distant future ("life-long learning").
